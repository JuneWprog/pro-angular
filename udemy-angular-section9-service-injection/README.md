# Services

## What is service?
Services allow you to share data or functions across the application

Dependency Injection means:

Instead of a class creating its own dependencies (objects it needs), someone else gives them (injects them) into the class.

ðŸ§  Why use Dependency Injection?
âœ… To make code easier to manage
âœ… To make code more testable
âœ… To follow the Single Responsibility Principle (each class focuses only on its job)

Dependency = what you need (service, object).

Injection = getting it from outside, not building it yourself.

Angular DI = system that provides dependencies automatically.
